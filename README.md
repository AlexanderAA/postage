# Postage - A fast alternative to PGAdmin

If you'd like to try Postage please go to ["Releases"](https://github.com/workflowproducts/postage/releases) and download the appropriate package for your OS. 

### Application mode
Releases marked "3.x.x" are Application mode packages. They run in a desktop window and can connect to Postgres locally or remotely. These packages are self contained and very easy to install and remove. Note that all the thanks for our wonderful installation process goes to Github and the Electron team.

### Web Server mode
Releases marked "Source code" run like a web server. This enables you to connect to Postage from any browser, even on a phone. Remember to set your firewall appropriately, or even better, use a VPN. This mode is the only mode available for phone/tablet access. This mode makes it easy to install Postage on one box, then have multiple developers log in and work. We find it convenient when we're at a client site and need to work from whatever workstation we're in front of at that moment.

## Release Schedule

Currently we release twice a month. 

## FEEDBACK AND BUG REPORTS

Please contact us with your feedback! Github issues and pull requests are welcome. Please report any issues you have for [FREE support](https://github.com/workflowproducts/postage/issues).

## Licensing

Postage is built on Envelope technology. Postage and Envelope are products of Workflow Products, LLC. However, we would very much like Postage to be a community project. Anyone presenting a quality patch that asks for commit privileges will likely receive them! 

Since Postage runs in a browser we don't really know what will happen if you use Postage with a non-UTF8 PostgreSQL database. If you experience a problem then please post an issue to [Github Issues](https://github.com/workflowproducts/postage/issues).

Postage is free for personal and commercial use. If you like some or all of Postage's functionality and the current license won't suit your needs, custom licensing is available starting at $99. Please call Justin at Workflow Products, 817-503-9545 for details.

## Why?

It's a long sad story really. Let's look at the bright side instead. Postage is pretty awesome. It's also a demonstration of [Envelope](https://github.com/workflowproducts/envelope), our application platform that makes building desktop-quality database applications on top of PostgreSQL or SQL Server a breeze.

Once you try Postage we hope it inspires you to have a look at Envelope. Envelope can help you leverage your SQL skills to build rich web and desktop applications in less time than you ever thought possible. 

If you do give Postage a try then you have our gratitude. Let us know what you think and we'll make it better!

## Roadmap

We aren't able to give any advance notice of features in development. However, if you are wondering about our commitment to Postage then wonder no longer. 

Workflow Products has committed an embarrassing amount of resources to Postage over the years. The current average for 2016 is two full time people and holding. With the new Electron version released, installation (and uninstallation) has never been easier. Therefore, it's time we move back into feature expansion. We have identified four major features we want to bring to Postage over the next six to eight months. The first is in development. Watch this space for announcements. Do you know of a feature that would make Postage better? Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/workflowproducts/postage/issues).

Workflow Products itself is healthier than it's ever been. We're celebrating our tenth year in November 2016. We're now at five full time employees and we expect to be around in another ten years. If you have any further questions please contact us directly at 817-503-9545. We'd love to hear from you.
